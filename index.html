            <h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
            <a href="https://medium.com/the-mighty-programmer/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a">Another article on progressive enhancement</a><br/>
            <p>
                Progressive enhancement is the development process in which the developer builds a website from the content outwards. In other words, you start with what you want to present, then add presentation to the content, then finally add functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Progressive enhancement is very important in modern development. Before styling or adding functionality to a web page, you want to make sure you have all the information you need to present. Sudden additions or removals can result in necessary changes to the rest of the site, which can hurt the developer and the client. Progressive enhancement helps reduce the workload by giving you and the client time to make sure the requested end product is how the client wants it without springing large, last-minute changes.

            <h3>Dragon Project Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                While collecting feedback from my father, we identified a few issues with the presentation of the website. One mistake was that the header background blended with the SpaceX logo, so I decided to move the logo above the header to make it clearly visible. Another issue was that the images on the history were inconsistently sized and that there was massive whitespace next to the images (fixed by nested flexboxes: one around the history blocks aligning the blocks vertically and one on each block aligning the image and paragraphs horizontally). The final mistake was that the body had no margin, which was fixed by adding padding to the main section. Afterwards, I added a script that allowed users to filter the FAQ.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project, I got another chance to review techniques we learned this semester. This includes the navigation style we made with the flexbox, which I recreated on this assignment, and the CSS styling for removing the margin around the body. I also used the !important modifier to enforce the font family, which I had never used in CSS before this semester. While working on the table, I also used pseudo-classes to target all children except the last child to make inner borders with no outside border. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I did well at making sure I got my assignments done at the right time. Most of the assignments I had little trouble with, especially the assignments involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of the other assignments, like the Gravit assignments, I had a bit more trouble with since I am not particularly skilled at graphical designing.
